;;; Commentary:

;; Claude Code IDE integration for Emacs provides seamless integration
;; with Claude Code CLI through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
;; It supports file operations, diagnostics, and editor state management.
;;
;; This package starts a WebSocket server that Claude Code CLI connects to,
;; enabling real-time communication between Emacs and Claude.  It supports
;; multiple concurrent sessions per project.
;;
;; Features:
;; - Automatic IDE mode activation when starting Claude
;; - MCP WebSocket server for bidirectional communication
;; - Project-aware sessions with automatic working directory detection
;; - Clean session management with automatic cleanup on exit
;; - Selection and buffer state tracking
;; - Tool support for file operations, diagnostics, and more
;; - Emacs MCP tools for xref and project navigation
;;
;; Usage:
;; M-x claude-code-ide - Start Claude Code for current project
;; M-x claude-code-ide-continue - Continue most recent conversation in directory
;; M-x claude-code-ide-resume - Resume Claude Code with previous conversation
;; M-x claude-code-ide-stop - Stop Claude Code for current project
;; M-x claude-code-ide-switch-to-buffer - Switch to project's Claude buffer
;; M-x claude-code-ide-list-sessions - List and switch between all sessions
;; M-x claude-code-ide-check-status - Check CLI availability and version
;; M-x claude-code-ide-insert-at-mentioned - Send selected text to Claude
;;
;; Emacs MCP Tools:
;; To enable Emacs tools for Claude, add to your config:
;;   (claude-code-ide-emacs-tools-setup)
