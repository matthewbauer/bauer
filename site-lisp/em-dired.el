;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides utilities for working with directories in eshell.  They
;; aim to make eshell integrate into Emacs better.

;; This makes eshellâ€™s cd behave like dired where each new directory is a new
;; buffer.

;; Installation

;; It is recommended to install this as a package.
;; Type M-x followed by:
;; package-install<RET>eshell-extras

;; Usage

;; use-package:
;; (use-package eshell-extras
;;   :after eshell)
