;;; Commentary:

;; Provides Emacs Lisp code to deal with setting defaults for an Emacs
;; distribution, in a similar way to ‘custom-set-variable’. The
;; ‘standard-value’ is set to ensure that Emacs recognizes the new
;; default.

;;; Code:

;; install advice to prevent custom-declare-variable from overwriting defaults
;; below
(require 'custom)

                             (cond ((car (get symbol 'standard-value)))
                                   (default))
                             doc args)))
